# netsec-framework

I wrote this framework with the following in mind:

- User able to run using built in Python 2.* on Debian based systems.
- User can install all Kali Linux tools and menu.
- User is able to execute most nmap scans - with explaination of each scan type.
- Assisted nmap scans with the beginner in mind.
- Assisted IPtables configuration for MITM attacks.
- IP forwarding for MITM attacks including configurations for sslstrip.
- Various assisted MITM attacks built in.
- Other various tools to assist in network penetration tests.


The idea was to be able to boot a vanilla Debian install and launch this CLI. 
Without leaving the CLI the user would be able to setup their system and execute MITM attacks on their netework. 
I attempted to make it as user friendly as possible for those learning network attacks.

Instructions:
- Must be run as root. Everything else should be self explanatory once launched. 

-- Happy Hacking


This project is ongoing. Improvements are coming. I also welcome ideas to make it better, more useful etc.
